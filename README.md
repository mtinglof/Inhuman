# Inhuman
> A WIP webpage based card game

This is not my game, or game concept. Please check out the creator's kickstarter at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tommy-maranges/inhuman-conditions-a-game-of-cops-and-robots. I was a really big fan when the game was first announced and decided I wanted to try and emulate the game on a webpage for two players.
